<h3>How to edit *.m3d/*.a3d</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Open modes/path_to_vangers_data_dir.bat file in any text editor. Replace value of PATH_TO_VANGERS_DATA_DIR variable with path to Vangers "data" folder. It contains "game.lst" file, "resource" folder and other game resources.</li>
  <li>Launch modes/3d/m3d_to_obj.bat.</li>
  <li>Now modes/3d/intermediate_obj folder contains *.obj files of Vangers models. It's time to edit them. See docs/common/3d/3d_models.ods. If you want to edit wheels or weapon attachment points, see below.</li>
  <li>Launch modes/3d/obj_to_m3d.bat.</li>
  <li>Now modes/3d/out_m3d folder contains edited *.m3d/*.a3d models. You can copy contents of this folder to Vangers "data" folder to replace original models with edited ones. You should backup original data before doing so.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Advanced</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p>All models must have 3 vertices per polygon.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>By default, while converting from *.obj to *.m3d:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>model is moved so its center of extreme points coincides with origin point;</li>
      <li>new vertex normals are generated;</li>
      <li>new bound models are generated.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>*.m3d/*.a3d files consists of multiple models. During *.m3d/*.a3d to *.obj conversion, *.obj file is created for each of those models.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>*.m3d files always have main model. Example obj file name: m5_main.obj where "m5" is name of *.m3d file.</p>
        <p>Mechos *.m3d files may have several debris models. Example obj file name: m5_debris_6.obj where "m5" is name of *.m3d file, "6" is debris number. Numbering must start from 1. Numbers must not be skipped. If there are debris 1 and 3, there must be debris 2.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>*.a3d files have several models. Each model is frame of animation. Example obj file name: a2_4.obj where "a2" is name of *.a3d file, "4" is frame number. Numbering must start from 1. Numbers must not be skipped. If there are frames 1 and 3, there must be frame 2.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When converting from *.m3d/*.a3d to *.obj, model is scaled using scale_size parameter from configuration files. When converting back to *.m3d/*.a3d, new scale_size is calculated and used to generate models and configuration files.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If new or edited weapon model will have higher scale_size than old weapon models, it won't be rendered properly with old mechos *.m3d files. In that case, you must use mechos *.m3d files generated at the same time with new weapon *.m3d file.</li>
      <li>By default, if calculated scale_size is higher than 0.560547, the program sets scale_size to 0.560547. Calculated scale size is higher than 0.560547 when distance between center of the model and its farthest vertex is higher than 68.947281.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Materials of polygons are used to determine color for those polygons in the game and to mark special polygons.</p>
    <p>Game uses palette with 256 colors. Each material has multiple colors assigned from dark to light. Last color in the palette is never used, so body_green material, for example, has 1 less color.</p>
    <p>Colors in range from 0 to 127 are different for each world/cycle and are used by landscape.</p>
    <p>Colors in range from 88 to 119 are changed each second.</p>
    <p>Colors of material are determined by color offset and color shift.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Color offset specifies index of starting color.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Color shift determines number of colors. Exact formula is 1 + 123/2^shift. The result is rounded downward.</p>

    <p>For example, material with offset 32 shift 4 will have colors with indices from 32 to 39.</p>
    <p>See docs/common/3d/materials_table folder for full lists of materials for all worlds and cycles.</p>
    <p>Following materials are special. They are assigned to certain polygons only and should not be assigned to any other polygons.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>zero_reserved</li>
      <li>center_of_mass</li>
      <li>attachment_point</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each *.m3d/*.a3d may have custom set of colors for "body" material. Material of type body_offset_*_shift_* specifies offset and shift for this set of colors.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Specifying multiple sets of colors in the same model is not allowed. For example, if, let's say, body_offset_0_shift_0 material is already used, then using, let's suppose, body_offset_1_shift_0 or body_offset_0_shift_1 material will cause an error.</li>
      <li>Having "body" material and material of type body_offset_*_shift_* in the same model is allowed.</li>
      <li>Only set of colors of main model is used while generating *.m3d file. Only set of colors of first animated model is used while generating *.a3d file. Using material of type body_offset_*_shift_* in other models is allowed but does not affect colors of the resulting *.m3d/*.a3d file.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Polygons with *_wheel_* material suffix in mechos models are used to determine where wheels are located and which properties they have. Example: tube_wheel_2 where "tube" is material name, "_wheel_" is wheel suffix, "2" is wheel number.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All wheels' material suffixes must have wheel number at the end of material suffix. Numbering must start from 1. Numbers must not be skipped. If there are *_wheel_1 and *_wheel_3, there must be *_wheel_2. Different wheels must not have the same number.</li>
      <li>There are two properties which may be assigned to wheel: "steer" and "ghost". Those properties are specified with material suffix. So steering ghost wheel number 1 will have material suffix "*_wheel_steer_ghost_1" or "*_wheel_ghost_steer_1". All polygons of same wheel must have same set of wheel properties.</li>
      <li>Steering wheels are affecting ability of mechos to turn, so at least one such wheel should be present in any mechos, or it will be impossible to turn. While turning in the game, all steering wheels of the mechos model are visually turning.</li>
      <li>Ghost property means that the wheel model will be removed while converting to *.m3d, but the mechos will have data about the wheel. In the game mechos will behave like there is a wheel.</li>
      <li>When converting from *.m3d to *.obj, non-steering wheels are extracted as ghost ones.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Polygons with *_weapon_* material suffix in mechos model are showing where weapons will be located with current weapon slot location. Example: tube_weapon_3 where "tube" is material name, "_weapon_" is weapon suffix, "3" is weapon number. They are removed during *.obj to *.m3d conversion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Polygons with attachment_point material are part of weapon attachment point model.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This model must never be changed or scaled but may be moved.</li>
      <li>During *.obj to *.m3d conversion, all polygons with this material are removed.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>While they are part of weapon model, they indicate where is attachment point of weapon.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Must never be rotated.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>While they are part of mechos model, they indicate where weapon slots are located.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There must be *_weapon_* suffix at end of material name. Example: "attachment_point_weapon_3".</li>
          <li>At most there may be only 3 weapon slots.</li>
          <li>May be rotated only around y axis, the direction of which coincides with direction of forward moving of mechos.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During *.m3d/*.a3d to *.obj conversion, *.cfg file is generated for each *.m3d/*.a3d file. This configuration file is used while converting back to *.m3d/*.a3d.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>You can specify custom volume for each model.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Affects generation of center of mass and inertia tensor.</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>Used to determine mass.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Affects many calculations.</li>
              <li>Affects ram power.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><p>You can specify which models will use custom center of mass. More info about center of mass below.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>You can specify custom inertia tensor for each model.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Used in many calculations.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Those configuration files should not be used in most cases, since volume, center of mass and inertia tensor are generated automatically.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Polygons with center_of_mass material are part of center of mass model.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This model must never be changed, scaled or rotated. It may be moved.</li>
      <li>It's generated during *.m3d to *.obj conversion only when extract_center_of_mass option is specified in configuration file.</li>
      <li>It's used only when corresponding option is specified in *.m3d/*.a3d configuration.</li>
      <li>It's used to manually specify center of mass, which affects generation of inertia tensor. Automatic generation is recommended in most cases.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
