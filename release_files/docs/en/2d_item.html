<h3>How to edit *.bmp images of items</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Open modes/path_to_vangers_data_dir.bat file in any text editor. Replace value of PATH_TO_VANGERS_DATA_DIR variable with path to Vangers "data" folder. It contains "game.lst" file, "resource" folder and other game resources. On Windows some characters in path, "!" for example, will not be treated properly by batch script, so only letters and digits should be used. *.bat scripts are replaced by *.sh scripts in Linux and macOS versions.</li>
  <li>Launch modes/2d_item/bmp_to_tga.bat.</li>
  <li>Now modes/2d_item/intermediate_tga folder contains *.tga images of items. It's time to edit them. See docs/common/2d_item/items.ods. If you want to replace one of the images, see below.</li>
  <li>Launch modes/2d_item/tga_to_bmp.bat.</li>
  <li>Now modes/2d_item/out_bmp folder contains edited *.bmp images. You can copy contents of this folder to Vangers "data" folder to replace original images with edited ones. You should backup original data before doing so.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Important</h3>
<ul>
  <li>RLE compression must be disabled while saving *.tga images.</li>
  <li>All *.tga images must be 8-bit and must use default_resources/2d_item/items_outside.pal color palette. Images created with modes/2d_item/bmp_to_tga.bat already have this palette.</li>
  <li>Color with index 0 in the palette is transparent color.</li>
  <li>If nontransparent pixels of image will end up outside of inventory slot of item, this will cause graphical glitches.</li>
  <li>If resolution of image is more than 800x600, the cursor may "stuck" after selecting the item in the game.</li>
  <li>If you want to replace original image with new one, resize or crop new image, so it will fit in inventory slot of the item, and then convert it to 8-bit *.tga using palette of any original *.tga.</li>
</ul>
