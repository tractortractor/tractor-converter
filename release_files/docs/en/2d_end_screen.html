<h3>How to edit *.bmp end screens</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Open modes/path_to_vangers_data_dir.bat file in any text editor. Replace value of PATH_TO_VANGERS_DATA_DIR variable with path to Vangers "data" folder. It contains "game.lst" file, "resource" folder and other game resources.</li>
  <li>Launch modes/2d_end_screen/get_tga_screens.bat.</li>
  <li>Now modes/2d_end_screen/intermediate_tga_no_font_palette folder contains *.tga images of end screens. It's time to edit or replace them. See docs/common/2d_end_screen/end_screens.ods. Make sure that all images in this folder are 800x600, 8-bit and not using RLE compression. Last 16 colors in the palette of 256 must not be used. So while converting regular image to 8-bit, use 240 color palette.</li>
  <li>Launch modes/2d_end_screen/add_font_palette.bat.</li>
  <li>Now modes/2d_end_screen/intermediate_tga_final folder contains *.tga images of end screens with text palette. You can change it by editing last 16 colors of image palette.</li>
  <li>Launch modes/2d_end_screen/tga_to_bmp.bat.</li>
  <li>Now modes/2d_end_screen/out_bmp folder contains edited *.bmp images. You can copy contents of this folder to Vangers "data" folder to replace original images with edited ones. You should backup original data before doing so.</li>
</ol>
